Decentralize the management
We as humans perform very well under a certain set of rules or we are careful when we have someone supervising what we are doing. The very nature thatâ€™s embedded into our heads will lead us to slack of and in turn stop performing on a higher level and this in an organization can prove to disastrous when not corrected. The society too has a lot of malicious actors like this who would want to cheat people by tricking them into believing what they are buying is genuine. In this paper we suggest a solution by creating a platform using blockchain which will bring more transparency and security to the society we live under.
